The Fat Man is a tactical nuclear catapult weapon.

According to terminals found inside the [Fort Strong][strong] armory in [Boston][boston], the Fat Man was conceived, developed and tested at the location. Houses were built to mimic an urban area, to see how much damage the weapon would cause in an urban environment.

The M42 Fat Man is an effective mortar/artillery weapon, allowing a person to bombard a large area with good precision and deadly force. It uses a [mini nuke][mini] for ammunition which when fired, results in a small nuclear blast.
