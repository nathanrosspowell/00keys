RadAway is an intravenous chemical solution that bonds with radiation particles and passes them through the body's system. It takes some time to work, and is also a potent diuretic.

It cannot be used to keep away from, or resist radiation when entering radioactive areas like its relative namesake Rad-X, but is instead used for after receiving radiation to purge some of it from the body.

On top of being addictive, it has several adverse effects, most notably headaches, stomach pains, and hair loss.
