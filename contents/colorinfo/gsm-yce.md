These colors are taken from the style of Vault 111's door model.

A different model was used in the Massachusetts region. This model is very similar to the doors seen in the Capital Wasteland and Mojave Wasteland regions. When properly maintained and serviced, the door has a dark grey base, and has a bright yellow center and outer rim.
