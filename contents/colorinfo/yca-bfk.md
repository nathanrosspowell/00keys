Glowing ones or luminous necrotic post-humans are [ghouls][ghoul] who have absorbed so much [radiation][rads] that they glow in the dark. They have become living conduits of radiation to the point that radiation not only heals their combat injuries, but can be forcibly released from their bodies. They are most often considered outsiders even by other ghouls. The glowing ones emit radiation, so they can still be dangerous to normal humans even after their death
