The [Lucky 38][l38] is a hotel and casino on the [New Vegas Strip][nvs] in 2281. It is occupied only by Mr. House, the ruler of New Vegas, and his securitrons.

The most prominent element of the New Vegas skyline, the Lucky 38 is a pre-War relic and an enduring monument to Mr. House's vision of Las Vegas: luxury without decadence, refinement without elitism, class without snobbery. But to assume that it was just a casino is erroneous, as in the years leading up to the war, Robert House thoroughly modified the building in preparation for the upcoming nuclear war.
