A [Vault-Tec][vt] nuclear shelter, Vault 12 was located under the city of [Bakersfield][necro], [California][cali], and designed to house a thousand people. Its goal was to study the effects of radiation on the selected population by not closing the door. This resulted in the [ghoul][ghoul]-town of [Necropolis][necro].


"Under the sprawling metropolis of Bakersfield, lies the technological magnificence of Vault 12. Built with every amenity in mind for the prospective Vault Dweller, Vault 12 was given the "Pressed Vault Suit" award for attention to preparedness. Buried far underground, the protection that Vault Dwellers will receive will be unprecedented. Much like all other Vaults, Vault 12 has been fitted with the newest in Vault Water Purification Systems. Able to take even the waste located in the sewers of Bakersfield, this system is able to deliver over 15,000 gallons of pure, refreshing drinking water every day."
