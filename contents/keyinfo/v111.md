Vault 111 is a [vault][vault]-series fallout shelter developed by [Vault-Tec][vt]. Vault 111 is located near [Sanctuary Hills][sh], [Massachusetts][mass].

Vault-Tec designed Vault 111 to observe the effects of long-term cryogenic suspended animation on unsuspecting test subjects. Vault 111's staff consisted of an overseer and a small team of scientists, security guards, and facility maintenance personnel employed on a short-term basis. Test subjects were lured to Vault 111 from the nearby neighborhood of Sanctuary Hills and were placed in stasis pods after being told deceitfully that the purpose of the pods was for decontamination.
