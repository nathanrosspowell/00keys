Vault 101 is one of the [vault][vault] series of fallout shelters developed by [Vault-Tec][vt] in the northwest area of [Washington, D.C.][wash], near Tysons Corner. This vault is located northwest of [Megaton][megaton], and west of [Springvale][spring]. It was home to the [Lone Wanderer][wander] until they left to search for their [father][james].

The original and underlying purpose of the Vault 101 [vault experiment][vexp], was to stay closed indefinitely, in order to study the role of the [Overseer][over] when a vault never opened. The limited genetic material would eventually result in inbreeding, had no "new blood" ever entered. Vault 101 was supplied with most of the equipment it would need to function indefinitely, such as seen with spare parts for the water processor, but the vault did not receive a [G.E.C.K.][geck], a device that would only be useful for surface dwellers.
