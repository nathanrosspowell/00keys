The [Brotherhood of Steel][bos] is a quasi-religious technological organization operating across the ruins of post-war North America, with its roots stemming from the United States Armed Forces and the government-sponsored scientific community from before the Great War.

Originally developed and manufactured for the United States Army by American defense contractor West Tek, the [T-45d][t45] power armor was the first version of power armor to be successfully deployed in battle. In 2067, the first suit of T-45d power armor was deployed in Alaska during the start of the Anchorage Reclamation in the midst of the Sino-American War.
