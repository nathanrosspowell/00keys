Vault 87 is one of the [vault][vault] series of fallout shelters developed by [Vault-Tec][vt]. It is located northwest of Little Lamplight and southwest of Broadcast tower KT8. It is the birthplace of the super mutants and centaurs in the Capital Wasteland.

Vault 87's assigned experiment was the [Evolutionary Experimentation Program][eep], a military experiment which involved the use of a modified strain of [Forced Evolutionary Virus][fev] onto the Vault 87 residents. The experiment was done on the initiative of the [Mariposa Military Base][mmb] personnal, as evidenced by a terminal entry written by [Dr. Wayne Merrick][merrick], the vault's chief physician. On the day of the [Great War][war], the surface entrance was struck by a nuclear device, dooming the surface entrance with deadly amounts of radiations and destroying the main vault door.
