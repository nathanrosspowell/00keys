A group buy is when a collective group of people rally around a desired product and commit to purchasing that product. Entrusting their money for said product to the Group Buy leader/organizer. He/she then goes to the manufacturer and pays for the product. After an appropriate lead time for item production, the item(s) ship from the manufacturer to the organizer. He/she then packs each item and then sends them out to the individuals who are participating in the group buy. Group buys are not for people who expect instant gratification (please see Amazon, or Walmart.com for that, but don't expect products like this). Furthermore, in the case of these keycap group buys, it is more about making something new that has never existed before and putting it into the hands of fans to enjoy while gaming/computing experience at a relatively affordable price.

To put all of this in perspective, if a person were to buy 5 of one of the key designs we have available in our group buys, it would cost $45 flat up front cost to create the mold for the keycap. Then, let's say that person only wants 5 keycaps to be made. The cost is $25 each + the $45 mold fee. That comes to a total of $170.00 to make 5 keycaps.

The most current group buy is trying to get an upwards of 3,000 keycaps produced and thus driving the cost lower for everyone.
